This contains the various books, sources, etc I am learning
from. Mostly, these are for their own sake. 



So, what is the point? Basically, I want to form an education for
myself. This repo is 


most of the "setup" code required to run this stuff is written in
Ruby, as a Rakefile. 

to run it, do

    bundle exec rake

some various things (so far)



running todo

- rename to new version

plan? 

with list of exercises, figure out filename

grep file for STATUS: COMPLETE; if it has, then it is done


SICP - 

done using racket

to run and see output, 

    bundle exec rake sicp:run ex=<exercise number>

for example, to run the first exercise from the first chapter, 

    bundle exec rake sicp:run ex=1/1

To see a list of all exercises completed, etc,
    bundle exec rake sicp:status
